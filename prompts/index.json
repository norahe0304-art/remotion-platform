    "prompt": "Create a premium 10-second motion graphics intro using Remotion and React.\n\nBackground: Clean white canvas with a subtle light-gray grid pattern.\n\nSequence of Events:\n\nScene 1 (The Setup): precise row of 8 colorful, filled geometric shapes (Pentagon, Triangle, Square, Circle, Hexagon, Diamond, Circle, Triangle) centered on screen with even spacing (90px). They should have a gentle, organic \"breathing\" idle animation.\nScene 2 (The Morph): Trigger a dynamic sequence where the shapes jump up, spin 180 degrees in mid-air, and smoothly morph (using flubber) into the bold block letters \"R-E-M-O-T-I-O-N\". Add a ghost-trail effect behind them during the jump for speed.\nScene 3 (The Arrival): Fly in the Remotion Logo from the left side to hover near the 'R'. Have it snap into place with a spring animation and immediately perform a full 360-degree rotation.\nScene 4 (The Wipe): Execute a slow, cinematic exit. The logo should slide smoothly across the entire screen from left to right. Implement a \"Wipe Logic\" where each letter of \"REMOTION\" vanishes (scales down/fades out) exactly in sync as the logo passes over it, creating an erasing effect.\nTechnical Requirements: Use remotion springs for all physics (damping: 14 for jumps, damping: 300 for the slow wipe). No strokes on shapes, only filled vibrant colors.",
